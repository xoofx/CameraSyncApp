**CameraSyncApp** is a lightweight command-line tool for Windows that simplifies syncing photos and videos. It automatically transfers files from the DCIM/Camera folder of connected devices to a specified destination folder.

## ðŸ“– Usage

Install [.NET 8+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and run the following command:

```shell
$ dotnet tool install -g CameraSyncApp
```

Then you can run the tool with:

```shell
$ CameraSyncApp list # List all connected devices
```

Copy all images and videos from the Camera folder of a device:
```shell
$ CameraSyncApp sync --output C:\MyOutputFolder --name MyPhone
```

The tool organizes photos into folders based on the month they were taken. Each folder follows the naming convention `yyyy-MM-{name}`, where `yyyy` is the year, `MM` is the month, and `{name}` is a customizable identifier passed via the `--name` command line option.
